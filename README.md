arduino project
Created program to navigate a blind/blindfolded person through a route with stationary and moving obstacles. Used C language on Arduino microcontrollers to control peripherals like ultrasonic sensors, buzzers etc. Interrupts began when certain conditions were sensed, and buzzers/alarms were turned on.
